# Exercise 1

- x = 8
- y = 0
- a = 'Hello!'
- b = ''

Check if x and b are both True. If they are, print "Both x and b are true"
Check if y or a is False. If one is, print "Either y or a is false"
Check if either x or y is False. If one is, print out "Either x or y is false"
Then, only if either x or y is False, check if x is greater than y. If it is, print out "x is greater than y"
Hint: Put another if statement inside the first if statement!

Exercise 2: Most Clocks Are Normal, But Some Are Cuckoo!

Skill you're Practicing: Writing Conditionals

You're making a program for your coworkers that displays a message on their desktop's idle screen. Depending on the time of day, you want to print a different quote.

You'll create a variable, time, which has an integer value between zero and 23, representing the hour of the day in military time, which is a 24-hour clock.

Write a conditional statement with PHP code that prints exactly one message using the following rules:

- If the time of day is before 9 a.m. --> print the quote 'Morning is wonderful. Its only drawback is that it comes at such an inconvenient time of day.'

- Otherwise if the time of day is before or exactly 4 p.m. --> print the quote 'Working hard or hardly working?'

- Otherwise, if the time of day is before 8 p.m. --> print the quote 'How did it get so late so soon?'

- Otherwise, if the time of day is before 10 p.m. --> print the quote 'A day without sunshine is like, you know, night.'

- Otherwise, for any time 10 p.m. or later --> print the quote 'Burning the midnight oil!'

## Starter Code
``` 
<?php

$time = 8
